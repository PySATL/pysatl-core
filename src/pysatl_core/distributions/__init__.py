Distributions Subpackage
========================

Interfaces and default implementations for probability distributions used by
PySATL Core. This subpackage provides:

- characteristic wrappers (:mod:`.characteristics`);
- analytical and fitted computation primitives and canonical 1C conversions
  (:mod:`.computation`);
- a minimal standalone univariate distribution and the public distribution
  protocol (:mod:`.distribution`);
- numerical fitters between PDF/CDF/PPF (:mod:`.fitters`);
- a directed graph registry for characteristics, with invariants
  (:mod:`.registry`);
- sampling protocol and an array-backed sample type (:mod:`.sampling`);
- pluggable computation/sampling strategies with defaults (:mod:`.strategies`).

The public symbols are re-exported here for convenience, so typical users can
import from :mod:`pysatl_core.distributions` directly.

Notes
-----
- The univariate API is intentionally **scalar** for characteristics
  (``float -> float``). Sampling returns 2D arrays of shape ``(n, d)`` with
  ``d == 1`` for the univariate case.
- Conversions between characteristics are discovered over a directed graph
  and fitted on demand via strategy logic.

Examples
--------
Create a trivial continuous univariate distribution with analytical ``ppf(q)=q``,
draw a sample, and compute its log-likelihood under a uniform PDF:

>>> from pysatl_core.types import Kind
>>> from pysatl_core.distributions import (
...     AnalyticalComputation, StandaloneEuclideanUnivariateDistribution
... )
>>> PPF = "ppf"; PDF = "pdf"
>>> dist = StandaloneEuclideanUnivariateDistribution(
...     kind=Kind.CONTINUOUS,
...     analytical_computations=[AnalyticalComputation[float, float](PPF, lambda q: q)],
... )
>>> sample = dist.sample(5)           # shape (5, 1)
>>> sample.shape
(5, 1)
>>> # Provide an analytical uniform pdf to compute log-likelihood:
>>> dist_uniform_pdf = StandaloneEuclideanUnivariateDistribution(
...     kind=Kind.CONTINUOUS,
...     analytical_computations= \
...         [AnalyticalComputation[float, float](PDF, lambda x: 1.0 if 0.0 <= x <= 1.0 else 0.0)],
... )
>>> dist_uniform_pdf.log_likelihood(sample)  # log(1)*5 == 0.0
0.0
